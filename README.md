# libwupsxx

A C++ wrapper library for [libwups](https://github.com/wiiu-env/WiiUPluginSystem).

This library is a bit more natural for C++ developers than the original.

Configuration items are implemented from scratch, with a few extra features.

Note that libwupsxx does not map to 100% of libwups, but it's good enough for 90% of use
cases.
